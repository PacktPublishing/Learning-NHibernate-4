#Learning NHibernate 4
This is the code repository for [Learning NHibernate 4](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-nhibernate-4?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784393564), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
SELECT a_.FirstName,
 a_.LastName,
 a_.EmailAddress,
 a_.Age
FROM tblCustomer a_
WHERE a_.Age > 28 AND a_.Age < 35
```

Though this book is code heavy, readers should be able to follow this book, if they
have, at least, any version of Visual Studio and MS SQL Server. The book makes
use of the following pieces of software:
• Visual Studio 2013
• SQL Server 2012 Express
• NuGet
• NUnit
• SQLite
• NHPro fi ler
• ReSharper
If you are using Visual Studio 2010 or higher, you should be able to run the sample
code of the book. SQL Server 2012 Express is used in the book, but any version of SQL
Server up to SQL Server 2008 should work. NuGet is used to download NHibernate,
NUnit and SQLite. NHPro fi ler is used to capture the SQL generated by NHibernate
but SQL Pro fi ler or NHibernate logging should do, if NHPro fi ler is not available.
ReSharper is the author's favorite code refactoring companion for Visual Studio,
but it's strictly optional.
